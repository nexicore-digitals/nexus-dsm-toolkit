## üß± Code Structure

Understanding the project's layout will help you find your way around:

* `src/parsers/` ‚Äî Core logic for CSV and JSON parsing.
* `src/validators/` ‚Äî Modules for syntax checks, header validation, and quote balance.
* `src/converters/` ‚Äî Logic for transforming data between CSV and JSON formats.
* `src/adapters/` ‚Äî Integration layers for external libraries (e.g., PapaParse adapter).
* `src/constants/` ‚Äî Shared constants and configuration values used across the project.
* `src/types/` ‚Äî Shared TypeScript interfaces and type definitions.
* `src/utils/` ‚Äî General utility helpers and shared functions.
* `__tests__/` ‚Äî Contains all unit and integration tests (feel free to add new test fixtures here!).

## ‚úÖ Contribution Guidelines

To maintain code quality and ensure smooth collaboration, please adhere to these guidelines:

* **Focus on Modularity:** Keep logic pure, testable, and contained within its relevant module.
* **Type Safety:** Maintain strong type safety with clear TypeScript interfaces and types.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Add tests for any new functionality, bug fixes, or edge cases you introduce.
* **Code Style & Linting:** Ensure your code adheres to the project's style conventions.
    ```bash
    # Run ESLint to check for code quality and style issues
    npm run lint
    ```
* **Pull Request (PR) Etiquette:**
    * Keep your PRs focused on a single logical change.
    * Branch from `main` for new features or bug fixes.
    * Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages (following Conventional Commits if possible, but descriptive is key!).
    * Provide a detailed description in your PR explaining the problem it solves and how.
